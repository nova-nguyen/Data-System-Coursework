# Planning for Week 7

## High Level Topic Summary

  - Hierarchical Data Model
      - Tree Structure
      - JSON and XML Formats
      - Procedural Traversals of trees

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 15.1-15.3, 2.4 | 15.7, 15.11 (with two tables separately)
Tuesday    | Sections 16.1-16.2 | none
Wednesday  | Section 15.4 | none
Friday     | Section 16.3 | none

## Progression

We start the week working to understand the structure of the hierarchical model with allied concepts of paths to represent traversals through that structure.  From this, we then look at the two most common formats for representing hierarchical data: JSON and XML.  We can immediately understand some of the procedural (tree) operations on JSON data, as it only relies on nested Python data structure, which we have seen before.  By the end of the week, we introduce analogous procedural tree operations for XML-based data structures.

Monday: Formally introduce the hierarchical model, with JSON as an example.

Tuesday: Complete software lab on using JSON with Python, as well as JSON procedural operations.

Wednesday: Discuss XML as an alternative hierarchical data representation.

Friday: Extend discussion of hierarchical procedural operations to XML-based data structures.
