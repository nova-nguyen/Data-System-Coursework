# Planning for Week 2

## High Level Topic Summary

  - Dictionaries, DoL 2D representation
  - Review so far
  - New Python Features
      - Functions as objects, lambda functions
      - List comprehensions (if time allows)

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Tuesday    | Sections 3.2 and 3.4.1| 3.35, 3.102, 3.104
Wednesday  | n/a          | n/a
Friday     | Section 3.3  | 3.57, 3.59, 3.62

## Progression

Goal of the week is finish review topics and native Python representations so that we are in a place at the end of the week to read chapter 5 and set up and motivate the tabular data model.

Tuesday: Review/learn about dictionaries and build dictionary-of-list representations of data.  

Wednesday: Review Python and content so far.

Friday: Continue review, learn about functions as objects and lambda functions (and list comprehensions, if time allows).

## Projected Homework

HW | Day Assigned  | Day Due (by 4pm) | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
[HW_1.c](../hw/HW_1.c/README.md) | Friday (1/21) | Friday (1/28) | Review of Python basics
[HW_1.d](../hw/HW_1.d/README.md) | Friday (1/28) | Monday (1/31) | Lambda functions and list comprehensions

We will be spending Wednesday (and possibly part of Friday) reviewing, so the due date of HW 1.c is pushed back to Friday.

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [second software lab](../sw_lab/lab_02/swlab_02.md), we'll explore dictionaries as well as the dictionary-of-lists (DoL) representation of data.
