## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 12.1-12.3.1 | none
Tuesday    | Sections 12.3.3-12.4 | 12.54, 12.58, 12.60
Wednesday  | Sections 12.5-12.6   | none
Friday     | Sections 14.1-14.4   | none

## Progression

This week, we will consider multi-table SQL expressions, and then begin discussing the principles needed to create **our own** databases. 

Monday: We will introduce the SQL syntax for performing inner joins between tables in a relational database.

Tuesday: We will expand our SQL toolbox to more complex inner joins, as well as different types of outer joins.

Wednesday: We will see how these composite/joined tables give us additional power when we do group by and aggregation, and also how we can use a subquery, often which contains a joined table, as part of a larger query.

Friday: We will launch into some of the most important principles for when we need to create **our own** databases.  SQL for table creation and for population of tables with data will be covered as time permits.
