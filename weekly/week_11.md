## Progression

This week, we will consider multi-table SQL expressions, and then begin discussing the principles needed to create **our own** databases. 

Monday: We will introduce the SQL syntax for performing inner joins between tables in a relational database.

Tuesday: We will expand our SQL toolbox to more complex inner joins, as well as different types of outer joins.

Wednesday: We will see how these composite/joined tables give us additional power when we do group by and aggregation, and also how we can use a subquery, often which contains a joined table, as part of a larger query.

Friday: We will launch into some of the most important principles for when we need to create **our own** databases, including those related to the design of tables and their fields.
