## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 8.4, 9.1-9.2.2, 9.3.1 | 9.16, 9.18, 9.20
Tuesday    | Section 9.2.3 | none
Wednesday  | Section 9.3.2-9.4  | none
Friday     | n/a | n/a

## Progression

This week we will complete our unit on the Tabular Data Model.  We will learn about operations that *transform* row-column data into altered structures.  To do this, we need to understand the operations themselves, as well as to apply them in settings where they are needed--namely to take data in messy form and to normalize them.

Monday: Discuss handling of mising data, then introduce tabular transformation operations of transpose and melt.

Tuesday: Complete software lab focusing on the tabular transformation operation of pivot.

Wednesday: Explore examples of using tabular transformations to normalize data sets to be tidy.  Also recap Tidy Data requirements and discuss characteristics of untidy data (therefore, how to recognize why data isn't tidy).

Friday: Quiz 2.  (Lessons 11-22, including Wed. 2/23.)

## Projected Homework

HW | Day Assigned  | Day Due (by 4pm) | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
[HW_2.f](../hw/HW_2.f/README.md) | Monday (2/21) | Wednesday (2/23) | Tabular Transformations

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [sixth software lab](../sw_lab/lab_06/swlab_06.md), we'll explore the pivot tabular transformation operation, and its application in making tabular data tidy.
