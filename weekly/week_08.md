# Planning for Week 8

## High Level Topic Summary

  - Hierarchical Data Model
      - Declarative traversals of trees using XPath
      - Constraints and enforcement

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 16.4.1-16.4.3, 16.4.7 | none
Tuesday    | Sections 16.4.4-16.4.6 | none
Wednesday  | Sections 17.1-17.3 | 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, 17.7
Friday     | Section 17.4 | none

## Progression

This week, we extend our study of XML operations to include XPath as a declarative alternative to the procedural traversal and access operations we've seen using `lxml`'s `etree` module.  Then, we address the constraints of the hierarchical model, more formally defining the syntactic rules and then layering constraints that specify value and tree-relationship limitations on an XML structure.

Monday: Introduce XPath for declarative XML operations.

Tuesday: Complete software lab on using XPath.

Wednesday: Discuss hierarchical model constraints.

Friday: Consider XML schema constraints.

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [eighth software lab](../sw_lab/lab_08/swlab_08.md), we'll continue practicing working with XPath to process XML data.
