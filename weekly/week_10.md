## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Chapter 10 (all) | 10.2, 10.14, 10.15
Tuesday    | Sections 11.1-11.3 | none
Wednesday  | Sections 11.4-11.6 | 11.69, 11.78, 11.80, 11.85
Friday     | Sections 12.1-12.3 | none

## Progression

This week, we begin the third of our data models covering the *forms* of data treated in this course, namely the *relational database model*.

Monday: We will highlight the most important aspects of the model, with its structure and typical architectures.  We will introduce and define many terms we will need over the next three weeks.  This treatment will give a glimpse at one of the core advantages of databases: **design before data population**.

Tuesday: We will begin our discussion of the SQL language, and its use in declaring the data desired from single tables in a database, starting with column projection and row selection.

Wednesday: We will extend our use of SQL to include computing on column-vectors of a result and performing partitioning and aggregation for single tables.

Friday: We will discuss using SQL to work with multiple tables via inner joins.
