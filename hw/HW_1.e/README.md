# CS-181/DA-210 Homework 1.e

The goal of this HW is to help you practice using list comprehensions and the List-of-Lists (LoL) data representation.

Note that you must complete this homework alone.  You should not discuss code specifics or share Jupyter notebooks with anyone.

---

## Step 1: List comprehensions

Complete [`listcomp.ipynb`](listcomp.ipynb).  This notebook contains exercises involving list comprehensions.

---

## Step 2: List-of-Lists (LoL)

Complete [`LoL.ipynb`](LoL.ipynb).  This notebook contains exercises using the LoL data representation.

---

## Step 3: Submission

Recall the general  submission workflow, summarized here:

- Make your changes to complete the homework.

- Use the terminal command `git add <filepath>` for each file that you've changed and want to submit.  For this homework, you'll likely want the following (remember that `$` represents the prompt, so you don't type that part):

    ```
    $ git add hw/HW_1.e/listcomp.ipynb

    $ git add hw/HW_1.e/LoL.ipynb
    ```

- You can use the command `git status` to verify that you've added the files you want to have in the commit.

- Use the terminal command `git commit -m "<commit message>"` to create a local commit.  For this homework, you could use:

    ```
    $ git commit -m "Completed HW 1.e"
    ```

- Use the terminal command `git push -u student main` to push your changes to your private Github repository; your instructor will pull from your repository in order to grade your homework:

    ```
    $ git push -u student main
    ```
