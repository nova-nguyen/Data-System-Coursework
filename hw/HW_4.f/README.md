# CS-181/DA-210 Homework 4.f

The goal of this HW is to help you practice database design, focusing on relationships between tables.

**Note that you may only complete this homework with a partner if you are partners for the final proejct.  You _must_ include the name of your partner, if any, in the cell at the end of database_design2.ipynb.**

## Step 1: Database Design

Complete Parts A, B, and D of [`database_design2.ipynb`](database_design2.ipynb).  (You may skip part C.)  This notebook contains exercises that continue to guide you through the process of designing a relational database.

## Step 2: Submission

Recall the general submission workflow, summarized here:

- Make your changes to complete the homework.

- Use the terminal command `git add <filepath>` for each file that you've changed and want to submit.  For this homework, you'll likely want the following (remember that `$` represents the prompt, so you don't type that part):

    ```
    $ git add hw/HW_4.f/database_design2.ipynb
    ```

- You can use the command `git status` to verify that you've added the files you want to have in the commit.

- Use the terminal command `git commit -m "<commit message>"` to create a local commit.  For this homework, you could use:

    ```
    $ git commit -m "Completed HW 4.f"
    ```

- Use the terminal command `git push -u student main` to push your changes to your private Github repository; your instructor will pull from your repository in order to grade your homework:

    ```
    $ git push -u student main
    ```
