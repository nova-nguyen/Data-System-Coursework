# CS-181/DA-210 Homework 2.b

The goal of this HW is to help you practice operations to query data and perform computations using those data.

Note that you must complete this homework alone.  You should not discuss code specifics or share Jupyter notebooks with anyone.

---

## Step 1: Access and Computation Operations

Complete [`access.ipynb`](access.ipynb).  This notebook contains exercises using tabular access and computation operations, including single- and multi-column projection and vector operations.

---

## Step 2: Submission

Recall the general submission workflow, summarized here:

- Make your changes to complete the homework.

- Use the terminal command `git add <filepath>` for each file that you've changed and want to submit.  For this homework, you'll likely want the following (remember that `$` represents the prompt, so you don't type that part):

    ```
    $ git add hw/HW_2.b/access.ipynb
    ```

- You can use the command `git status` to verify that you've added the files you want to have in the commit.

- Use the terminal command `git commit -m "<commit message>"` to create a local commit.  For this homework, you could use:

    ```
    $ git commit -m "Completed HW 2.b"
    ```

- Use the terminal command `git push -u student main` to push your changes to your private Github repository; your instructor will pull from your repository in order to grade your homework:

    ```
    $ git push -u student main
    ```
