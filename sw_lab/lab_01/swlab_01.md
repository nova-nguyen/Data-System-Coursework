# CS-181/DA-210 Software Lab 1

The goal of this SW Lab is to get your machine set up for use in this course, and to review some basic OS operations using the command line and Python.

Throughout the course of the software lab, you'll encounter several checkpoints.  You'll need to get "check-offs" for each of these with the instructor.  During class, you can get a check-off with your partner.  If you come in to office hours later in the week, you can get a check-off either individually or with your SW Lab partner for the week.

## Step 1: Git Setup

First, complete Parts A-D of the [computer setup Git walkthrough](../../general/computer_setup_git.md) to set up Git on your machine and to clone the course git repository.  There are two checkpoints for this step.

## Step 2: Python Setup

Once you have the repository cloned, complete Parts A-C of the [computer setup Python walkthrough](../../general/computer_setup_python.md) to ensure that you have Python set up on your machine.

## Step 3: OS Navigation in Python

Finally, complete the [filebasic](filebasic.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  There is one checkpoint for this step.
